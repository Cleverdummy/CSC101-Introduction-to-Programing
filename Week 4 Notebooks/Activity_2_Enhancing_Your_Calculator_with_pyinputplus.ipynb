        "\n",
        "In this worksheet, you will recreate the simplified calculator from Activity 1:\n",
        "- Break a problem into smaller, manageable functions.\n",
        "- Reinforce the concept of returning values from functions.\n",
        "- Apply modular design principles, which will be useful when we later build a full weather dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also learn how to use an external library called **pyinputplus** to improve input validation in our Python programmes. In our Python notebooks, you can run shell commands by prefixing them with an exclamation mark (`!`).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Discovering pyinputplus\n",
        "\n",
        "Beginners often discover pyinputplus by exploring online tutorials, coding forums, or by browsing the Python Package Index (PyPI) when they search for ways to improve input validation. A quick search for \"Python input validation library\" might lead you to pyinputplus as a popular and simple solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, engaging with the wider Python community—through blogs, tutorials, or course materials—can provide insights into how and why to use external libraries like pyinputplus. Reading the official documentation and experimenting with example code will help you understand its benefits and prepare you to explore other tools that extend Python's capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Installing pyinputplus\n",
        "\n",
        "To use pyinputplus, you need to install it. In a code cell in your notebook, run the following command:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install pyinputplus\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Tip:*  If you run into issues, try searching for \"how to install python packages in Jupyter Notebook\" or ask an AI tool, e.g., \"How do I install the pyinputplus package in a Python notebook?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# pyinputplus Basics\n",
        "\n",
        "The **pyinputplus** library provides functions like `inputInt()`, `inputFloat()`, and `inputChoice()` for getting input with built-in validation. Here are some simple examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
        "\n",
        "# Ensures the user enters a float\n",
        "number = pyip.inputFloat(\"Enter a number: \")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Ensures the user enters one of the provided choices\n",
        "choice = pyip.inputChoice(['1', '2', '3', '4'], prompt=\"Enter your choice (1-4): \")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Note:* pyinputplus will repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is entered, which reduces the risk of errors from invalid data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reimplementing the Calculator\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to rewrite your simple calculator code from a previous worksheet, but now use pyinputplus to handle user input. Specifically, you should:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Replace built-in `input()` calls with `pyip.inputChoice()` for getting the operation choice.\n",
        "- Replace the `input()` calls for numbers with `pyip.inputFloat()` (or `pyip.inputNum()` to allow both integers and floats).\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Hint:*  Reuse the modular design from your previous worksheet. Your functions for performing calculations can remain largely unchanged, but the way you gather user input will now use pyinputplus.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Bonus Challenges (Optional)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Division by Zero:**  \n",
        "  Enhance your divide function by checking for division by zero. You might use an if-statement after obtaining the input, or explore pyinputplus's `applyFunc()` for additional validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Using Additional pyinputplus Options:**  \n",
        "  Experiment with `pyip.inputNum()` to accept both integers and floats.  \n",
        "  Try using the timeout or retry options in pyinputplus to further improve input handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Key Teaching Points\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Modularity:**  \n",
        "  External libraries, such as pyinputplus, extend Python's built-in functionality and help make your code more robust and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Validation:**  \n",
        "  Robust input validation is crucial for preventing errors and ensuring that your programme behaves as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Error Prevention:**  \n",
        "  Using pyinputplus minimizes runtime errors by continuously prompting until valid input is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Community Resources:**  \n",
        "  PyPI is a valuable resource where you can find many community-developed Python packages that can save you time and effort.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Discovering Modules and Packages\n",
        "\n",
        "While today's worksheet focuses on using pyinputplus, it's important to realise that it's just one example of the many powerful modules available to Python developers. When you need to extend Python's functionality, you can explore the Python Package Index (PyPI) to find community-developed libraries that meet your needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to Discover Useful Modules:**\n",
        "- **Online Tutorials and Blogs:**  \n",

        "- **Community Forums:**  \n",
        "  Forums such as Stack Overflow and Reddit’s r/learnpython are great places to ask for recommendations.\n",
        "- **Course Materials:**  \n",
        "  Your course might introduce certain packages as you progress, giving you a curated list of tools to try.\n",
        "\n",
        "By learning how to find and integrate external modules, you will be better equipped to tackle more complex projects. The skills you develop here—searching for packages, reading documentation, and testing new libraries—will be invaluable in your future projects, including your final assignment where you'll build a comprehensive weather dashboard.\n",
